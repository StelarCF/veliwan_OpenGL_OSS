CHANGELOG

Current:
v0.2.1dts (stable release of v0.2)

Planned:

Roadmap (engine):
v0.3 - wheels, spheres, actually using the collision mesh for collisions, rotational velocity, quaternion rotation, instantiable objects
v0.4 - GUI, friction, models from non-custom files, LUA scripting, configurable global variables
v0.5 - physics constraints(Fixed, Hinge, Ball), multi-shader rendering, basic sound system
v0.6 - shader improvements (Anti-Aliasing, Anisotropic filtering, Shadows/Shading), player-physics constraints (car control), new camera (rotating around object), more advanced sound
v0.7 - maps (tracks), more shader improvements (to be determined), main menu, better foldering/files
v0.8 - objectives (race, battle tag -- scriptable), map editor, "career" mode, HUD
v0.9 - multiplayer
v0.10 - release candidate 1 for engine
v0.11 - release candidate 2 for engine (if necessary)
v1.0 - game release engine

Roadmap (game):
v0.4 - a few car models, some props, some textures
v0.5 - more car models, environment models, a couple of songs
v0.7 - more car models, environment models, some more songs, a couple of tracks
v0.8 - more tracks, more car models, most of the songs, tracks for battle tag
v0.9 - most of the tracks, most of the cars, all of the songs, most of the tracks
v0.10, v0.11 - finish up all tracks
v1.0 - Everything finished

Roadmap (debugger):
v0.3 - debugging tool written in ncurses reaches stable
v0.6 - debugger written to use lua for greater customizability
v1.0 - debugger not in production, ok?

Older:
v0.2dtex
========
Features
+ Added on-detect collisions
--------
Known Bugs
- If cube doesn't fall straight down, it will be teleported out of the floor (you can still theoretically find it). Fix is planned for v0.3
- Once the cube "settles" on the floor it starts jittering. Fix is planned for v0.3.

v0.1.2dtqf
==========
Bugfixes
+ Fixed OpenGL 3.0 shaders, made them work on other systems

v0.1.1dtqf
==========
Bugfixes
+ Stopped crashing on other systems by adding OpenGL 3.0 shader compatibility
----------
Other
+ Changed display resolution

v0.1dts
=======
Features
